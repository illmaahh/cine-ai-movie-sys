# 🎬 Cine AI – Movie Recommendation System

Cine AI is a modern, AI-inspired movie recommendation system designed to help users discover movies based on their interests, genres, and viewing preferences. The project demonstrates the practical application of recommendation system concepts using a clean, interactive, and scalable web interface.

This project has been developed as a **B.Tech 5th Semester Minor Project** and focuses on combining software engineering principles with intelligent recommendation techniques.

## 📌 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital streaming platforms, users are often overwhelmed by the massive volume of available content. Traditional browsing methods are inefficient and fail to personalize recommendations according to individual user preferences.

There is a need for an intelligent system that can:
- Analyze movie data
- Understand user interests
- Provide meaningful and personalized movie recommendations

Cine AI aims to address this challenge by implementing recommendation logic within a responsive and user-friendly web application.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Cine AI analyzes movie-related data such as genres, categories, and metadata to recommend similar movies to users. The system focuses on **content-based filtering**, where recommendations are generated by comparing movie attributes rather than relying on other users’ data.

The application is built using a component-based architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clean code structure.
